        <h1 class="mb-5">About Me</h1>
        <div class="mb-5">
          <p>An engaging way that I was able to understand my skills was through taking the notable ‘Gallup StrengthsFinder 2.0’ Assessment. This assessment consists of four domains of talent - <i>Executing, Influencing, Relationship Building and Strategic Thinking</i>.</p> 

          <p>This detailed evaluation generates five core skills of a person. A person’s skills fall within the five domains listed above. All five of my skills consist of two domains - <i>influencing</i> and <i>relationship building</i>. </p>

          <p>The domain <i>influencing</i> is pretty self-explanatory. It is an individual’s ability to enable and advocate for others and produce big ideas. People in this category tend to influence forward both internally and externally. </p>

          <p>The domain relationship building is an individual’s innate ability to take the human component into the equation. People in this domain create pathways for people to thrive and strive and often succeed in forming influential connections with others. ‘Relationship builders’ make strong relational connections that bind a group together around a cause, idea or each other.</p>

          <p>Now to what my five <em>core skills</em> are….</p>

          <ul class="skills-list">
            <li>
              <h3><i>Communication</i></h3>
              <p>The skill of communication in this test means the ability to communicate, whether verbal or non-verbal, about <em>how they are feeling and how they are connecting to people all around them</em>. People with the strength of communication want to express themselves in any form and are not afraid to create new and unique ways to do so. The most beneficial strength to those who possess the skill of communication is the <em>ability to help others express themselves</em>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3><i>Woo</i></h3>
              <p>Woo? That sounds odd, right? Well, that’s because woo is an acronym and stands for ‘winning others over’. Woo is a social intelligence theme. People with the ‘woo’ core skill <em>have an innate capacity to inspire and motivate those around them</em>. ‘Woo’ers’ are almost always aware of not only themselves but those around them. They are also <em>extremely invitational and aim to include and connect with everyone they interact with</em>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3><i>Empathy</i></h3>
              <p>It did not surprise me to find that this is one of my core skills. I have been an empath from the time I was young, which is a large reason that I was drawn to the counseling and mental health field. People with this core skill <em>are welcoming and provide a safe place for people to express their feelings</em>. This ability brings a sense of peace and comfort to others. People with empathy see the world through an individual’s lense and take into reflection the feelings and emotions of others. People who hold empathy as a core skill typically have a high EQ or emotional quotient. This type of intelligence perceives and understands others as well as effectively regulates emotions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3><i>Individualization</i></h3>
              <p>It intrigues me every day that there are over 7.5 billion people on Earth and that among all these people each and every person has their own story and qualities that make them who they are. I love to embrace the uniqueness in those I interact with which is definitely my core skill of ‘indivdiualization’ in the works. The StrengthsFinder test defines those with this strength to see each person as one of a kind. <em>They are intrigued by the unique qualities of each person and readily notice other’s think and are motivated</em>. People with this core skill pay close attention to every individual and <em>articulates a person’s strengths - what makes each person valuable, important and unique.</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3><i>Positivity</i></h3>
              <p>I understand that life comes with high and uplifting moments as well as painful, valley seasons. While I take time to acknowledge the difficult times I try to live my life with a positive mindset by practicing gratitude and optimism. The Strengths Finder test defines people with the positivity skill as those who are lighthearted and always looking for and discovering the positive. <em>People with the strength of positivity are remarkably impactful because they have the ability to lighten the mood with people and within groups</em>. Because of their ability to impact those around them, it is not surprising that <em>people are drawn to a person who radiates positivity.</em></p>
            </li>
